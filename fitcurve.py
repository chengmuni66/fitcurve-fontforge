# A script for manipulating control points of a bezier curve to make it
# more 'square' or more 'round'.
# I've seen a similar feature in Glyphs (glyphsapp.com).
# To use it, select at least two consecutive points,
# then run the fit curve script under Tools menu,
# enter a number (0 retract the handles, the curve becomes a line,
# with 100 the two handles are extended until they touch,
# if you enter a number greater than 100, handles cross,
# the curve becomes concave).
# If the handles of the selected bezier segment are parallel,
# or the segment is a line, nothing happens

# Place this script in ~/.FontForge/python/ as usual
